# Motivations-Collection

A simple html page to place all the motivational quotes and prayers. Later this will be designed properly with a proper backend.

# Purpose of this repo

1. It contains quotes from all over the globe so anyone's free to contribute.

2. Right now the repo contains a single html page, which acts as a collection dump for all the quotes different people have to offer. So it's pretty simple to contribute.
